# GOV-C2-024 — Public Tender Document Comparison Agent

> **Category**: Cat 2 (orchestrates multiple steps to accomplish a specific use case)
> **Industry**: GOV (government)

## Overview

Ingests multiple public procurement tender documents (RFP/RFQ/仕様書) alongside a
vendor capability profile, then produces a structured comparison report:
a requirement-by-requirement coverage matrix, eligibility assessment, and a risk/gap
summary with a go/no-go recommendation. Automates the 20–40 hour manual comparison
process for Japanese public procurement (会計法/地方自治法).

This is an agent template built with the **AGENTIC STAR** development platform and the
**AgentCore Framework**. It is intended to be taken as a starting point: fork it, adapt it to
your own data and policies, and run it inside your own AGENTIC STAR deployment.

## Requirements

**This template does not run standalone.** It requires:

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **AGENTIC STAR platform** | The agent connects to the platform at start-up. Deployment guides and API documentation: [AGENTIC STAR Developers](https://developers.fd.agenticstar.tm.softbank.jp/) |
| **AgentCore Framework** (`agenticstar-agentcore`) | Installed from PyPI as a dependency. |
| Python | >=3.11 |

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Project Structure

```
src/          agent implementation (nodes, services, schemas)
tests/        unit, integration and boundary tests
config/       agent configuration
docs/         design and operational documentation
```

See `docs/` for the design spec and test specification.

## Customising

1. Adjust `config/` for your own environment and policies.
2. Replace the knowledge sources and sample data with your own.
3. Review the node implementations under `src/nodes/` for domain-specific logic.
4. Re-run the test suite.
